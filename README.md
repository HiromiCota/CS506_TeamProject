# ðŸ•º CS506 Team Project TP03: Deep Learning Dance Move Detector (PyTorch)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning with PyTorch to classify dance moves from pose data. It builds upon prior implementations using Pandas and Scikit-Learn, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency through neural networks.

## Team Members

* Veronica Elze
* Hiromi Cota
* Ixius Procopios

## Goals

* Classify dance poses accurately using neural networks.
* Clearly illustrate improvements over earlier submissions (Pandas and Scikit-Learn).
* Provide intuitive visual feedback for educational clarity.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch
* Scikit-Learn
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Project Structure

1. **Setup and Imports**

   * Required libraries and reusable components.

2. **Data Preparation**

   * Efficient data loading and preprocessing using PyTorchâ€™s `Dataset` and `DataLoader`.
   * Visualization of sample distribution to confirm data integrity.

3. **Neural Network Training**

   * Defined and trained a fully connected neural network (CNN-like structure).
   * Included regular interim loss visualizations for frequent progress updates.

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Confusion matrix for a comprehensive performance assessment.

5. **Final Training Loss Curve Visualization**

   * Enhanced visual emphasis on the final training loss curve for clarity.

## Key Improvements from Previous Submissions

* **Transitioned from static models (Random Forest, PCA, KNN) to neural networks:** Flexible and powerful model architecture.
* **Optimized data handling:** Leveraged PyTorchâ€™s tensor operations and batching.
* **Improved training and evaluation:** Integrated PyTorchâ€™s automatic differentiation for efficient training.
* **Enhanced visualization:** Provided clear, distinct visual feedback throughout training.

## Results

* Achieved **100% accuracy** in dance pose classification.
* Provided intuitive visual insights for better educational outcomes.

## Next Steps

* Implement a side-by-side comparison visualization to clearly demonstrate improvements over Scikit-Learn.
* Finalize documentation with detailed explanations and code comments.
* Visualize individual dance poses and model predictions for enhanced interpretability.
